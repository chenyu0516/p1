This is a simple program show the result of Bernoulli test. This probability event is a working process decided by flipping coins. In this program, the variable p is the probability that coins will flip to the head side. If the result is head, the player of this test should go forwards a step, and if the result is the other side, the player should go back a step. The variable test_index show how many flipping game the player should play in a Bernoulli test, and test_round assigns how many Bernoulli tests the program should round.
